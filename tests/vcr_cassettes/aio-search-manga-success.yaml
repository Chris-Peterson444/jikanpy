        in plain sight, an age-old conflict rages on. Supernatural monsters known
        as \"Curses\" terrorize humanity from the shadows, and powerful humans known
        as \"Jujutsu\" sorcerers use mystical arts to exterminate them. When high
        school student Yuuji Itadori finds a dried-up finger of the legendary Curse
        Sukuna Ryoumen, he suddenly finds himself joining this bloody conflict. Attacked
        by a Curse attracted to the finger''s power, Yuuji makes a reckless decision
        to protect himself, gaining the power to combat Curses in the process but
        also unwittingly unleashing the malicious Sukuna into the world once more.
        Though Yuuji can control and confine Sukuna to his own body, the Jujutsu world
        classifies Yuuji as a dangerous, high-level Curse who must be exterminated.
        Detained and sentenced to death, Yuuji meets Satoru Gojou\u2014a teacher at
        Jujutsu High School\u2014who explains that despite his imminent execution,
        there is an alternative for him. Being a rare vessel to Sukuna, if Yuuji were
        to die, then Sukuna would perish too. Therefore, if Yuuji were to consume
        the many other remnants of Sukuna, then Yuuji''s subsequent execution would
        truly eradicate the malicious demon. Taking up this chance to make the world
        safer and live his life for a little longer, Yuuji enrolls in Jujutsu High,
        jumping headfirst into a harsh and unforgiving battlefield. [Written by MAL
