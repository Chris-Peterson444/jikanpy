        at their core: - The main cast are mostly child soldiers. - It''s not as simple
        as good vs. bad; there''s a lot of moral ambiguity. - Both stories revolve
        around the horrors of war. Despite superficially being very different shows
        that even belong to entirely different genres, it''s hard not to see the parallels.
        If you like a cynical take on political intrigue and conflict, and flawed
        main characters faced with responsibilities they aren''t well-equipped to
        handle, check out either story. Additionally, there is a lot of attention
        to the workings of the technology used in these stories, as well as tactics
        and strategy. Attack on Titan showcases cavalry tactics and the ODM gear its
        soldiers use, while Gundam explores the intricacies of outer space as a battleground
        and the workings of its mobile suits. Lastly, mobile suits and Titans are
        not so different in scale, so I think Attack on Titan captures the feeling
        of fighting against an enemy that entirely outclasses you in a way that meaningfully
        complements how Gundam displays the might of its mobile suits.","date":"2022-12-03T00:00:00+00:00","user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/Gamesaucer","username":"Gamesaucer"}},{"mal_id":"18153-21353","entry":[{"mal_id":18153,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/18153\/Kyoukai_no_Kanata","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/3\/85468.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/3\/85468t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/3\/85468l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/3\/85468.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/3\/85468t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/3\/85468l.webp"}},"title":"Kyoukai

        ranked getting the most focus after the main characters. Basically, the 13
        Court Guard Squad Captains are the Hashira, while the Espada are the Twelve
        Kizuki. While Ichigo and Tanjiro seem to have nothing in common on the surface,
        and indeed they are very, very different, they do have one major thing in
        common- they''re both very protective older brothers, with the reason they
        became a Soul Reaper\/Demon Slayer being to protect their younger sister(s).
        They also have much simpler goals than a usual shounen protagonist- Ichigo
        just wants to save and protect as many people as he can while Tanjiro just
        wants to cure his sister, with his revenge against Muzan being more of a side
        thing. I think \"Bleach\" is better, due to having more complexity to its
        story and characters, but that''s just me. In any case, both are well worth

        anime that revolve around an organization of people who protect humanity from
        demons (in \"D.Gray-man\", they''re called Akuma, but it''s the same basic
        thing). They both have four main characters, three boys and one girl, all
        of whom are similar to each other: Allen=Tanjiro===> Scarred, kind-hearted
        15-year-old boys who show sympathy even for the demons of the series and give
        a whole new meaning to \"killing with kindness.\" Lenalee=Nezuko===> Yamato
        nadeshikos who fight primarily using kicks, are very protective of their \"family\"
        and have an extremely protective older brother. Kanda=Inosuke===> Dumbest
        and rudest of the four, very arrogant and short-tempered and frequently pick
        fights with allies and enemies alike. Lavi=Zenitsu===> Bipolar, sleep often
        and wield lightning-based attacks. Additionally, in terms of role, the Demon
        Slayer Corps is the Black Order, the Twelve Kizuki are the Noah Family and
        Muzan himself is the Millennium Earl. Both anime also take injuries seriously,
        in that if someone breaks a bone, they''re not going to be fine after only
        a day or two. Additionally, \"Demon Slayer\"''s \"The Song of Tanjiro Kamado\"
        draws a few cues from \"D.Gray-man\"''s \"The 14th Song\". While I can''t
        say for certain, since \"Demon Slayer\" is still ongoing, so far I''d say
        both shows are equally good, with \"D.Gray-man\" having a better story, and
        \"Demon Slayer\" having better visuals and music. Basically, if you''ve watched
        one, you should definitely watch the other.","date":"2022-12-03T00:00:00+00:00","user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/Joe_Devaney","username":"Joe_Devaney"}},{"mal_id":"33203-47917","entry":[{"mal_id":33203,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/33203\/Fukumenkei_Noise","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/85350.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/85350t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/85350l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/85350.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/85350t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/11\/85350l.webp"}},"title":"Fukumenkei
