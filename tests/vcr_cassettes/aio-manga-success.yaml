        are knowledgeable and naturally talented individuals who can manipulate and
        modify matter due to their art. Yet despite the wide range of possibilities,
        alchemy is not as all-powerful as most would believe. Human transmutation
        is strictly forbidden, and whoever attempts it risks severe consequences.
        Even so, siblings Edward and Alphonse Elric decide to ignore this great taboo
        and bring their mother back to life. Unfortunately, not only do they fail
        in resurrecting her, they also pay an extremely high price for their arrogance:
        Edward loses his left leg and Alphonse his entire body. Furthermore, Edward
        also gives up his right arm in order to seal his brother''s soul into a suit
        of armor. Years later, the young alchemists travel across the country looking
        for the Philosopher''s Stone, in the hopes of recovering their old bodies
        with its power. However, their quest for the fated stone also leads them to
        unravel far darker secrets than they could ever imagine. [Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Hagane
