        prior to Naruto Uzumaki''s birth, a huge demon known as the Kyuubi, the Nine-Tailed
        Fox, attacked Konohagakure, the Hidden Leaf Village, and wreaked havoc. In
        order to put an end to the Kyuubi''s rampage, the leader of the village, the
        Fourth Hokage, sacrificed his life and sealed the monstrous beast inside the
        newborn Naruto.\n\nNow, Naruto is a hyperactive and knuckle-headed ninja still
        living in Konohagakure. Shunned because of the Kyuubi inside him, Naruto struggles
        to find his place in the village, while his burning desire to become the Hokage
        of Konohagakure leads him not only to some great new friends, but also some
        deadly foes.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":"Naruto received numerous
        awards during its airing, including the \"Best Full-Length Animation Program
